<h1>{% trans "Online judge manual" %}</h1>

<p>{% blocktrans %}The online training system is a tool to help you improve
your programing skills. It is open to everyone, and obviously free. What
follows is a guide to understand its principles and get the most out of it.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Problems" %}</h2>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
The problems given during the previous editions of the Prologin contest are
archived and available on this website. You can train with the problems of the
qualification and semifinals problems of the previous years. They are ordered
by year and difficulty: from beginner to advanced.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Evaluation" %}</h2>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
The exercises are evaluated by our server: your program is compiled then tested
automatically. It is executed once per test. The possible errors are:
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<ul>
  <li>{% trans "Your program does not compile;" %}
  <li>{% trans "Your program exceeded the time limit given in the subject;" %}
  <li>{% trans "Your program exceeded the memory limit given in the subject;" %}
  <li>{% trans "Your program gave a wrong result for at least one test;" %}
  <li>{% trans "Your program does not terminate correctly." %}
</ul>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
If there is a compilation error, the error output of the compiler is shown.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
The output produced by your program has to match exactly with the format given
in the subjects. The correction system compares the output with a reference
output, character by character.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
After the tests have been executed, a summary is shown, indicating which tests
succeeded and which tests failed. The output of your program and the output
given by the correction system is shown only for the first failed test. The
exercise will only be considered solved when all the tests succeed.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
The correction can take up to several minutes, so be patient.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Score" %}</h2>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
The training system grades your submissions. Every solved exercise gives you
a number of points that depends of the level of the problem and the number of
failed attempts you tried. You should test your program yourself before
submitting it.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Code stubs" %}</h2>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
For some languages, we provide code stubs that can "parse" correctly the data
given in the standard input of the program. You only need to write the content
of a stub function that takes these parsed data in parameter. Note that it is
absolutely not mandatory to use these stubs, although they can be really
useful most of the time.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "Correction system" %}</h2>

<h3>{% trans "Time and memory limitations" %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}
Every problem enforces some limits in terms of memory usage and execution time.
Some coefficients are applied on some slower or memory greedy languages. No
particular limitation is applied on the stack size.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "Hardware architecture" %}</h3>

{% with hardware_cpu="Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1241 v3" hardware_clockrate="3.50 Ghz" hardware_architecture="x86_64" hardware_byteorder="Little Endian" hardware_ncpu="1" hardware_mem="3" %}

<p>{% blocktrans %}
Your programs are executed in a virtual machine with an {{ hardware_cpu }}
with a clock rate of {{ hardware_clockrate }} and an
{{ hardware_architecture }} architecture. The byte order is
{{ hardware_byteorder }}. The virtual machine has {{ hardware_ncpu }} dedicated
vCPU and {{ hardware_mem }} Gio of dedicated random access memory.
