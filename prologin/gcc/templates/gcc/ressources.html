        When coding, we describe information that the machine will execute. To be able interact with the machine, we need to choose the language we will write in.
        There are many existing languages, each with their specificities.

        It's important to know in which language we want to start programming in when starting because we learn to program in a language.
        During the summer camps we mainly teach Python, which we recommand to start.
        It's an easy language to start with (compared to other...) and it has many uses. Youtube for example is coded in Python.

        The good thing when learning to program, is that it can be used in many ways, to do plenty of things
        There are a lot of sub domain or application in computer science, and to keep coding, it's more fun to find somethong we realy like
        Here are some examples:

              On the website, you can find archives of the previous years exercises.
              They are small exercises that give a entry and expect a precise answer, and it's your task to code the program givig the expected answer !
