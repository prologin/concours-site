  <h2 id="organization">{% trans "A computer enthusiasts organization" %}</h2>
  {% blocktrans %}<p class="text-justify">The purpose of Prologin is to enable young computer enthusiasts to meet and compete with one another. Indeed,
computer science is still largely under represented in French schools. Therefore, those who practice it are
often self-taught and have an individual practice of it. However, any large project requires teamwork. This is
why, even though candidates seat the exam individually, the competition should facilitate the exchange of ideas
between candidates. To promote these exchanges, the Prologin team tries to design the contest topics so they
put forward playful aspects. Meanwhile, everything is done so that participants can and should exchange ideas
within a cheerful atmosphere. Combining work and pleasure is therefore a key objective of Prologin.</p>

<p class="text-justify">We want to allow the candidates to take advantage of the competition to enhance their skills. We try to cover as
many areas of computer science: artificial intelligence algorithms, general culture, various programming
languages…</p>

<p class="text-justify">For the organizers, the competition is an opportunity to manage a team and to organize a event. We must also
learn how to communicate effectively in order to make it known to a wider public. Managing relations with
sponsors, creating statements and solving both technological and logistic issues are also an enriching
experiences for our staff members.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Finally, for all the survivors who reach the final, it is also the opportunity to spend a super crazy weekend
with us!</p>

<h2 id="gcc">{% trans "Girls Can Code!" %}</h2>
<p class="text-justify">{% blocktrans %}In 2014, Prologin started to organize the Girls Can Code! summer camps.
These training camps are the perfect occasion for young girls who are still in middle school or in high school
to discover multiple computer science subjects throughout the week. They will learn how to solve problems with
algorithms, explore various computer science topics such as network, web development, robotics, microcontrollers, video games
and more through practical exercises.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p class="text-justify">{% blocktrans %}Conferences from exterior speakers are organized for every camp. It enables the attendees
to exchange with women working in the computer science industry or in academia. The young girls are sometimes
unsure as to what they want to do, this is a golden occasion for them to discuss their education with the speaker,
thus helping them for future orientation choices.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p class="text-justify">{% blocktrans %}Prologin staff is present during the camp to help them debug their programs and pass on
knowledge in computer science and programming.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="contribute">{% trans "Everyone can contribute to Prologin" %}</h2>
  {# TODO: link to forums; link to how to promote (posters) #}
  {% blocktrans %}<p class="text-justify">Contributing can be done in various ways: promoting the event, developing the website and
the software architecture for the final, helping during the regional events, contributing in the forums, and so on.
We also appreciate your feedback and your suggestions.</p>

<p class="text-justify">We also need your help with the training section, where users can try themselves on a large set of statements.
If you can give us a hand, please do: we are looking for new statements (originals or translations of third parties),
courses, and corrections. Of course, please contact us before contributing so we can prevent certain parts
being done in duplicate.</p>
