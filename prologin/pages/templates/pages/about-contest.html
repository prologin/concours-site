The event lasts one day and takes place on a Saturday in January or February,
depending on the city. Candidates are divided into various sessions in
different examination centers all across France.
The evaluation is based on three tests: a written exam on an original
algorithmic problem, some unrelated problems to solve on the computer
and an interview with one of Prologin's staff members.

Candidates have to program an artificial intelligence of their own for
a custom-made game, in just 36 hours. All the candidate submissions are
assessed by competing against each other using an automated match-making system.
It is also a unique opportunity to meet other computer enthusiasts, in a cheerful
