  <p>{% blocktrans %}The regional event tests are intended to test the capability of candidates to solve algorithmic
problems but also to implement theirs solution on a machine, in the programming language they prefer. This is also an
opportunity for candidates to meet other enthusiasts, and for the organizers to relate their experience, to help
them progress.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
  <p>{% blocktrans %}The 200 to 300 selected candidates are divided into different regional events, which take place in
multiple sessions from mid-January, in the following French cities: Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Nantes,
Lille, Toulon, Louvain-la-Neuve and Bordeaux.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2>{% trans "The three tests" %}</h2>

  <h3>{% trans "The written exam" %}</h3>
    <p>{% blocktrans %}The written exam lasts three hours. The test consists of
    a series of five or six questions around a common theme. These questions of
    increasing difficulty guide the contestant in the stages of resolution of
    an algorithmic problem. The first exercices focus on modeling the problem
    and are here to check that the candidate masters the basic principles of
    algorithms, and the next exercises require the contestant to code effective
    algorithms for harder problems.{% endblocktrans%}</p>

  <h3>{% trans "The interview" %}</h3>
    <p>{% blocktrans %}The interview lasts between ten and twenty minutes. It
    is a way for us to meet individually every contestant, test their knowledge,
    learn about the personal projects he works on, while giving him advices to
    improve.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h3>{% trans "The practical test" %}</h3>
    <p>{% blocktrans %}The practical test lasts three and a half hours. Every
    contestant works on algorithmic exercises on a computer. A judging program
    evaluates the code submissions of the contestant. The goal of this test is
    to check that the contestant is able to code a program on a computer (choose
    an algorithm, implement it in a programming language, test it and debug it).
    {% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}All these tests are individual. No other documents than
    those given by Prologin are authorized.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}The contestants are welcomed at 8h30 AM, and meet together
    while having a free breakfast provided by Prologin. The written exam takes
    place between 9 AM and 12 AM, during which they also have an interview with a
    Prologin organizer.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}Before or during the lunch, also provided by Prologin,
    the organizers present a quick correction of some of the problems the candidates have
    just worked on.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}The day continues with the practical test, which lasts
    three and a half hours, and ends at 5:30 PM.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2>{% trans "Evaluation methodology" %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktrans %}The exam submissions are marked according to the
    validity and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. The syntax of the
    languages used and other similar aspects are not taken in account, as they
    are already needed for the coding exercises.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}After the interview, a grade is also given according to
    various criteria.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}The grade of the practical test is attributed
    automatically by the juding system, according to the number of solved
    exercises, the number of tries to achieve that, and the time spent on each
    exercise before a correct solution was found.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}The final ranking, after which a hundred contestants are
    selected, is obtained from these three grades.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2>{% trans "Logistics" %}</h2>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}The regional events are spread over several weekends, during
    which between one to three regional events take place in different locations.
    {% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}A team of at least three Prologin members is dedicated
    to the logistics of each event, to prepare the equipment, welcome the
    contestants, monitor the tests, take care of the food and assist the
    contestants during the practical test.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <p>{% blocktrans %}All the exam centers where the regional events take place
    provide us with the computer equipment and the classrooms needed, and we
    are very grateful to them for their help.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
